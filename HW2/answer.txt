1. Difference between monolithic and microkernel
In monolithic kernels, the kernel is a large process running in a single address space where all the services exist in the same place. Any piece of the kernel can talk to any other part using simple function calls.

In a microkernel, the kernel is broken down into separate processes in separate address spaces. Different functions will have different kernels.

In a microkernel, if one process crashes, the other processes can still function well compared to the monolithic kernel, where if one process fails, the entire machine could crash too. It is also a lot smaller compared to the monolithic kernel. 
However, the microkernel falls short in terms of performance. It is slower than monolithic kernels. This is because of all the separate processes. 

2. Permissions of touch
-rw-r--r--
The permissions of touch are listed above. The permissions are that the file file owner can read and write the file, while others can only read, but not modify. 
To make the file executable for the user that owns the file, you have to use chmod u+x foo.txt.

3. What are file descriptors and how are they assigned?
A file descriptor is basically an integer number that represents the entry of an opened file. It is used to identify the file that has been opened.
A file descriptor value of 2 is possible. This is because if there is no error the value assigned to the file descriptor will be an integer that is 0 or greater.
